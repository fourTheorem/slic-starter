## Where to Contribute

There are are a number of areas where you can contribute right now.

1. The number one way to contribute right now is by using SLIC Starter to bootstrap a serverless project, deploying it and sharing your experience so we can improve it. We know there is plenty of scope to make the experience better but we want your guidance! How can we make it easier to configure and clearer to understand what's going on? What kind of documentation would make it better for you? Let us know in the _Issues_.
2. We label some of the open issues with the "help wanted" label. You can see them [here](https://github.com/fourTheorem/slic-starter/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22). Let us know in the issue if you are planning to work on ths issue so we can share ideas and to make sure we have the same understanding of the scope.
3. Sometimes we will label issues as "good first issue". If you are new to open source or just to some of the areas this project covers, these issues are a great way to get started. The list is [here](https://github.com/fourTheorem/slic-starter/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
